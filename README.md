Introduction
This README provides an overview of the chatbot you've created using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot utilizes OpenAI's API to have text-based conversations with users.

Prerequisites
Before you can run this chatbot, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

OpenAI API Key: You must have an API key from OpenAI, which you should set in the openai.api_key variable within your code.

Python Environment: You need a Python environment with the OpenAI Python library installed. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install openai
Usage
To use this chatbot, follow these steps:

Setting up your API Key: Make sure you've set your OpenAI API key in the openai.api_key variable within your code. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the OpenAI platform.

Running the Chatbot: Run the script, and the chatbot will start interacting with you in a text-based conversation. It will keep responding to your inputs until you type "quit," "bye," "stop," or "exit."

User Input: You can input text prompts, questions, or statements as the user. The chatbot will respond based on the input you provide.

Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the chatbot:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
  while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "bye", "stop", "exit"]:
      break

    response = chat_with_gpt(user_input)
    print("Chatbot: ", response)
Important Notes
API Key Security: Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly. Treat it as sensitive information.

API Usage Cost: Be aware that using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model through the API may incur usage costs based on OpenAI's pricing model. Ensure you are aware of and agree to the pricing terms.

Customization
You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the chat_with_gpt function and the conversation format in the messages list. You can also fine-tune the model to better suit your specific use case.
